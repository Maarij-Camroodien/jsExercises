//  1. Variables: containers for storing data 
//  2. Value: A value is the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by the program it is in
//  3. Data Types:  describe the different types or kinds of data that we're gonna be working with and storing in variables
//  4. Initialisation: Storing a value in a variable
//  5. Difference between var, let and const:var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value. const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value
//  6. What is the scope of a variable: the accessibility of a particular variable within the program
//  7. When can you decide when to use a for or while, forEach and do while loop: A for Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a number of times that is known.
//     -A while Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times until the conditions are met.
//     -A foreach loop is used when you need to operate on each item individually in an array.
//     -A do while loop is used in all scenarios where the loop body needs to be executed at least once.
//  8. what is hoisting: the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code
//    -What is variable scoping: the accessibility of a particular variable within the program
